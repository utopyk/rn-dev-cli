// Session supervisor. Owns the transition ladder
// stopped → starting → running → stopping → stopped and fans session
// events out to events/subscribe consumers via an EventEmitter.
//
// Named `DaemonSupervisor` to avoid colliding with the unrelated
// `Supervisor` in src/core/module-host/supervisor.ts (module-host
// crash-loop detector).
//
// Concurrency model: every `start()` captures an incrementing `bootEpoch`.
// `bootAsync` compares its captured epoch against the supervisor's
// current epoch before publishing its wired services. Any `stop()` or
// subsequent `start()` bumps the epoch, invalidating a boot that's
// still mid-flight; the losing boot disposes its partially-constructed
// services instead of leaking them. One daemon per worktree — we
// don't coordinate cross-daemon.
