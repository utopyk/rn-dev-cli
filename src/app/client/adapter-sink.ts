// Contract every client-side adapter implements for receiving events +
// lifecycle signals from a dispatcher. Phase 13.4 prereq #2.
//
// The 13.3 adapters exposed `_dispatch(kind, data)` — underscore prefix
// by convention to signal "only the session orchestrator calls this".
// That convention breaks down in Phase 13.4: Electron's main-process
// orchestrator AND its renderer-side mirror (future phase work) both
// need to push events into the adapters, and a method that reads as
// public is clearer than a two-site "internal" convention.
//
// Interface, not a class, so adapters keep their EventEmitter base
// and method shape. A future `BaseAdapter` helper could codify the
// rename further if adapters grow enough to warrant it — today the
// interface is load-bearing by itself.
