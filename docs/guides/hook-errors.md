# Hook error reference

This page lists every error code the rn-dev hook system can raise. Codes are
stable identifiers; renaming any of them is a major-version bump.

For the discriminated detail shape (typed via `HookErrorDetails` in
`@rn-dev/module-sdk`), narrow on `details.code` then on the per-code
fields named below (`cause`, `outcome`, etc.).

## Codes

### `E_HOOK_TARGET_UNKNOWN`

`consumes.hooks` references a `<id>/<name>` whose `<id>` is not a known module. Caught at config/manifest load — never surfaces at fire time.

### `E_HOOK_NAME_UNDECLARED`

`consumes.hooks` references a `<id>/<name>` whose target module exists but does not declare `<name>` in `provides.hooks`. Includes a did-you-mean suggestion in `details.suggestion`.

### `E_HOOK_PATH_OUTSIDE_PROJECT`

Script path resolves outside the config-file's containing directory after `realpathSync`. Fires when a symlink-then-prefix-check would otherwise be bypassed.

### `E_HOOK_OVERRIDE_NOT_PERMITTED`

A 3p module's `consumes.hooks` registers against another module's `custom` override slot but the project did not opt in via `allowModuleOverrides: ['<id>']`.

### `E_HOOK_CONFIG_INVALID`

Project's `rn-dev.config.ts` failed to load or shape-validate. The `cause` discriminator (see `HookConfigInvalidCause`) names the specific subkind — clients render specific guidance per cause.

### `E_HOOK_FAILED`

A hook fire failed at dispatch time. The `outcome` discriminator (see `HookFailedOutcome`) names the specific subkind. Recovery is the calling site's choice (some are retried, some abort the RPC).

### `E_HOOK_RUN_REAL_DENIED`

`hooks/run` MCP tool received `mode: "real"` while the daemon is running with `RN_DEV_DAEMON_MODE=prod`. Synthetic mode is also rejected outright in production.

### `E_HOST_RANGE_REQUIRED`

Manifest declares `provides.hooks` or `consumes.hooks` but its `hostRange` allows daemon versions that pre-date hook support. Older daemons would silently ignore the declarations.

### `E_HOOK_INTERPRETER_MISSING`

Hook script's shebang interpreter (or implicit `node`/`bun` runtime) cannot be resolved on the host. Surfaced at fire time, not registration, because PATH membership is dynamic.
