// MCP-side e2e harness — Bug 6's missing test layer.
//
// `tests/electron-smoke/real-boot.spec.ts` covers Electron behavior end-
// to-end against a live daemon, but until this helper landed the MCP
// surface had no equivalent: the Phase-13.6 test grid only exercised
// `connectToDaemonSession` from inside vitest, never the actual MCP
// stdio server boot path that an agent sees. Bug 6 (`session/log`
// dropped in `routeEventToAdapters`) was invisible to the existing test
// grid for exactly this reason — a bug in the MCP-server-process
// behavior, not in any unit under test.
//
// This helper spawns the real MCP server as a child process via
// `StdioClientTransport`, then returns an SDK `Client` you can drive
// with `callTool` / `listTools`. Pair with `spawnTestDaemon` to wire
// MCP against a fake-boot daemon so tests run fast (~1-2s) and don't
// require Metro/RN tooling. Real-boot variants belong in
// `tests/mcp-smoke/` — env-gated like `real-boot.spec.ts`.
