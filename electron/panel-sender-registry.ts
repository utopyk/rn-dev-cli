// Phase 5b hardening — sender binding for `modules:*` ipcMain channels.
// Phase 6 Security P1-1 — split host trust into read vs. write tiers.
//
// Before this file existed, `modules:host-call` / `modules:config-get` /
// `modules:config-set` handlers trusted the `moduleId` field on the
// renderer payload. A panel preload (or any webContents that reaches
// ipcRenderer) could invoke one of those channels with another module's
// id and defeat permission gating.
//
// The registry binds each sandboxed panel's `WebContents` to its
// moduleId at view-creation time and trusts the main BrowserWindow's
// `WebContents` as the host UI. Handlers consult the registry via
// `_event.sender` and reject mismatched moduleIds.
//
// Phase 6 adds a second tier: the host UI is trusted for READS to any
// module (marketplace:list, modules:list, modules:config-get — safe) but
// only allowed to WRITE to an explicit allowlist of module ids. Settings
// is the only host-writable module today; future host-native panels that
// need to write cross-module config register via `allowHostWrite(id)`.
// The previous "host can rewrite anything" behavior was a renderer-XSS
// compromise amplifier.
//
// This file imports `electron` types only — no runtime symbols — so it
// is still safe to import under vitest. The runtime `.webContents`
// references live in `panel-bridge-electron.ts` + `ipc/index.ts`.
